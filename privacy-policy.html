    <h1>Synagamy Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Synagamy ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the Synagamy mobile application (the "App").</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Synagamy is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal health information on our servers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Synagamy does not collect personal health information. All fertility predictions and calculations are performed locally on your device.</p>
        <p>We do not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect personal identifying information</li>

            <li>Share data with third parties</li>
            <li>Transmit medical data to our servers or any external services</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>Your input data and prediction results are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong> using encrypted iOS Keychain storage. This storage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Requires your explicit consent before any medical data is saved</li>
            <li>Uses industry-standard iOS Keychain encryption</li>
            <li>Is protected by your device's security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)</li>
            <li>Never leaves your device</li>
            <li>Is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties</li>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
