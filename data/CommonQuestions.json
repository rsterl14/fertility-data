    "question": "What is the difference between IVF and ICSI?",
    "short_answer": "IVF mixes eggs and many sperm in a dish to let one sperm enter naturally. ICSI uses a tiny needle to place a single sperm directly inside an egg.",
    "detailed_answer": "Both IVF and ICSI happen in the lab after eggs are collected. In conventional IVF, thousands of moving sperm are placed with each egg and one must attach and enter on its own. In ICSI, a specialist selects one sperm and injects it through the egg’s outer shell. ICSI is often used for low sperm count/motility, prior IVF fertilization failure, or when using frozen or surgically retrieved sperm.",

    "question": "How many embryos should we transfer?",
    "short_answer": "Most patients should generally transfer a single embryo to reduce the risk of twins and complications.",
    "detailed_answer": "Single-embryo transfer (SET) is now standard for most age groups, especially when a good-quality blastocyst is available. Transferring more than one embryo increases twin risk, which raises pregnancy complications for parent and babies. Your clinic will consider age, prior outcomes, embryo quality, and health history.",

  {
    "question": "What is a blastocyst?",
    "short_answer": "A day‑5 or day‑6 embryo with an inner cell mass (baby cells) and an outer layer (future placenta).",
    "detailed_answer": "After several days of cell divisions, the embryo forms a fluid‑filled cavity. The inner cell mass will form the fetus, and the outer trophectoderm forms the placenta. Blastocysts are often chosen for transfer or freezing because they’ve shown strong development.",

    "question": "Does PGT-A improve my chance of pregnancy?",
    "short_answer": "It can help choose embryos with the correct number of chromosomes, which may lower miscarriage risk and shorten time to pregnancy for some patients.",
    "detailed_answer": "PGT-A screens embryos for chromosome number. For some groups, it can reduce transfers of aneuploid embryos and miscarriage risk, potentially leading to faster pregnancy. Benefits vary with age, embryo count, and clinic workflow. It doesn’t fix egg or sperm quality and doesn’t guarantee a successful pregnancy.",

    "question": "Is embryo biopsy safe for the embryo?",
    "short_answer": "Modern blastocyst-stage biopsy is widely used and generally safe when performed by trained labs.",
    "detailed_answer": "Biopsy removes a few cells from the trophectoderm (the part that becomes placenta). Reviews and guidelines support its safety in experienced centers, though no procedure is risk‑free. Clinics use strict quality control and often freeze the embryo after biopsy while results are processed.",

  {
    "question": "What is a good embryo grade?",
    "short_answer": "Grades combine how the embryo looks and grows; higher‑quality blastocysts tend to have better chances, but grades are not guarantees.",
    "detailed_answer": "Embryo grading checks cell number, symmetry, and fragmentation (early) or expansion, inner cell mass, and trophectoderm (blastocyst). Grading helps prioritize embryos for transfer or freezing, but many ‘average’ embryos lead to healthy births.",

    "question": "What is a ‘freeze‑all’ cycle?",
    "short_answer": "All embryos are frozen and transfer happens in a later cycle, not the same cycle as egg retrieval.",
    "detailed_answer": "Freeze‑all can lower the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation in high responders, allow time for PGT results, or help optimize the uterine lining. Later, a thawed embryo is transferred in a natural or programmed cycle.",

    "question": "How long do frozen embryos last?",
    "short_answer": "Properly stored embryos can remain viable for many years.",

    "question": "What is AMH and what does it tell me?",
    "short_answer": "AMH is a hormone that reflects the number of growing follicles and is used as a rough indicator of ovarian reserve.",
    "detailed_answer": "Anti‑Müllerian Hormone (AMH) is made by small follicles. Higher AMH often means more eggs may be retrieved with stimulation, while lower AMH suggests a lower response. AMH does not predict natural fertility on its own or embryo quality directly.",

  {
    "question": "What does day‑3 vs day‑5 transfer mean?",
    "short_answer": "Day‑3 embryos are earlier (cleavage‑stage); day‑5/6 embryos are blastocysts. Many clinics prefer blastocyst transfer for selection, but it depends on your case.",
    "detailed_answer": "Cleavage‑stage transfer happens around the 6–8‑cell stage; blastocyst transfer is when the embryo has differentiated (ICM and TE). Extended culture can aid selection but may reduce embryo numbers for some patients.",

    "question": "Does age matter more than anything else?",
    "short_answer": "Age strongly affects egg quantity and quality and is a major driver of IVF outcomes.",
